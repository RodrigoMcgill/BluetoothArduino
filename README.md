# BluetoothArduino
Language: Java
Program: Android Studio

The program purpose is to establish a wireless communication means between an Android device and the HC-05 bleutooth arduino.
This is the basic set up. In order to test wheter the communication has been established or not, the app comes with 2 buttons that turns ON
or OFF an LED.

This program was done for my supervisor's field of research with orgranic printed  substrates to verify that communcation can flow within those
substrates.
